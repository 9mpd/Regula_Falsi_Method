# Regula_Falsi_Method
Iteration method to find root of a function.

### This method is  based on the first degree equation.

Geometrically, in this method we replace the function f(x) by a straight line, l
or a chord passing through the points (x<sub>k</sub>,f<sub>k</sub>) and 
(x<sub>k-1</sub>,f<sub>k-1</sub>) and take the point of intersection, c of the 
straight line with the x-axis as the next approximation to the root.

Equating slope of the line gives :
<strong>m = [f<sub>k</sub> - f<sub>k-1</sub>]/[(x<sub>k</sub>) - x<sub>k-1</sub>)] = [(-f<sub>k</sub>)/(c-x<sub>k</sub>)]</strong>
If the approximations are such that <strong>f<sub>k</sub> â…¹ f<sub>k-1</sub> < 0</strong> then the method is known as Regula Falsi method.
